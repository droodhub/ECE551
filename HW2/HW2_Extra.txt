a) Does it use a SPI, I2C, or UART interface?

It uses both an SPI and and I2C interface. To use the I2C interface, the CS line must be tied high. 
To select the SPI interface it must be tied low. They are both used to read/write to the registers.

b) Does the gyro output angular position, or angular rate?

It outputs angular rate. Counterclockwise around the given axis is considered positive rate.

c) If we wanted an output data rate around 200 readings per second does
it support that?

Yes, it should be supported. It can read up to 1700 samples per second, so 200 should be no problem.

d) How would we synchronize our Verilog with itâ€¦how would we know
it has a new set of measurements ready for us?

It has a register, STATUS_REG that is read by the primary interface. 3 bits in this register,
	TDA, GDA, and XLDA, are set to 1 if there is new data available for the temperature, gyro,
	or accelerometer, respectively. GDA is also found in the STATUS_SPIAux register. Depending on
	the mode of operation, there is also a FIFO register that will assert a flag when the number
	of unread samples in the register exceeds a certain value(not sure if this is what you were looking for, see page 32 on the datasheet).
