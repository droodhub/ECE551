# ECE551 Fall 2022
A collection of in-class exercises, homework, and the semester project for UW-Madison's ECE551. The final project implements a driver for a segway.
It controls steering, speed, plays audio, and detects when the rider gets on/off. Most homework assignments are steps towards the final implementation of the project.
